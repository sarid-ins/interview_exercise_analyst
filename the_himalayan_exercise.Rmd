   * Ability to translate a broad or vague idea into a research question, and then break it down to even more specific hypothesis, and extend it to models and visualizations.
   
   * Ability to employ data transformations, visualizations, and modeling in your analysis, in order to convey concepts and ideas. Choosing the right type of visualization and model to make your point.
   
   * Your capability to document your work and explain it to the reader.
